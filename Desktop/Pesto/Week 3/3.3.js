/* 0 is logged

The createIncrement function returns an array containing two functions: increment and log.

The increment function increments a local count variable and logs its value to the console.

The log function logs a message to the console that includes the current value of count at the time the createIncrement function was called. In this case, count is initially 0, so the message logged by log will always show "Count is 0", no matter how many times increment is called.

After assigning increment and log to separate variables using array destructuring, we call increment three times to increment count from 0 to 3.

Finally, we call log, which logs the message "Count is 0" because that was the value of count when createIncrement was called, and log never updates that message.

So the output shows that increment successfully increments the count variable on each call, but log always shows the initial value of count because it doesn't have access to the updated value.// What is logged?
